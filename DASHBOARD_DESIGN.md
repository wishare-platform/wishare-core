# Dashboard Design & Implementation Issues

## Current Status: BROKEN

The dashboard page at `/` (authenticated root) is not working properly despite multiple attempts to fix it.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Grid Layout Not Working
- **Problem**: Dashboard supposed to have 3-column layout (Left 25%, Center 50%, Right 25%)
- **Current State**: Single column layout, everything stacked vertically
- **Grid Classes Used**: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-6 lg:gap-8`
- **Column Classes**: `lg:col-span-3`, `lg:col-span-6`, `lg:col-span-3`

### 2. CSS/Styling Issues
- **Problem**: Poor contrast - dark gray text on dark background (unreadable)
- **CSS Issue Found**: CSS syntax error in `/app/assets/tailwind/application.css` around line 128
- **Fixed**: Missing closing brace in `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` block
- **Result**: Still not working after CSS rebuild

### 3. Content Structure Issues
- **Problem**: File was truncated during editing, content got replaced with placeholder `<h1>` tags
- **Fixed**: Restored complete dashboard content with all sections
- **Sections Include**:
  - Left: Pending invitations, Recent notifications
  - Center: Recent items showcase
  - Right: Friends grid, Upcoming events

## Failed Attempts & Debugging Steps

### CSS-Related
1. ✅ Fixed CSS syntax error (missing closing brace)
2. ✅ Rebuilt Tailwind CSS with `rails tailwindcss:build`
3. ❌ Grid layout still not applying
4. ❌ Contrast issues remain

### HTML Structure
1. ✅ Added proper grid container classes
2. ✅ Added column span classes for each section
3. ✅ Restored complete dashboard content
4. ❌ Layout still broken

### Investigation Done
1. ✅ Checked controller (`DashboardController`)
2. ✅ Checked routes (uses `application.html.erb` layout)
3. ✅ Verified other pages work (wishlists page grid works fine)
4. ✅ Confirmed Tailwind works on other pages
5. ❌ Dashboard-specific issue not resolved

## What Works vs What Doesn't

### ✅ Working
- Tailwind CSS on all other pages
- Grid layout on `/wishlists` page (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`)
- Dashboard content rendering (text, structure)
- Navigation, layout wrapper

### ❌ Not Working
- 3-column grid layout on dashboard
- Text contrast (dark on dark)
- Responsive design for dashboard
- Dashboard-specific styling

## Key Files Involved

- `/app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb` - Main dashboard view
- `/app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb` - Controller logic
- `/app/assets/tailwind/application.css` - CSS definitions (had syntax error)
- `/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` - Main layout wrapper

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Debug why grid classes aren't applying** - despite being present in HTML
2. **Fix contrast issues** - make text readable
3. **Test grid on desktop breakpoint** - verify lg: classes work
4. **Compare with working pages** - see what's different about dashboard

## Notes for Fresh Start

- The Tailwind classes ARE correct (as you said from the beginning)
- Other pages work fine, so it's dashboard-specific
- CSS syntax was fixed but didn't solve the layout
- May need to investigate compiled CSS output
- Could be JavaScript/Stimulus interference
- Could be conflicting CSS rules

## Time Spent
This issue consumed an extremely long debugging session with multiple failed attempts. The root cause is still unidentified.
